               <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering">aerospace</a> scientist and statesman who served as the 11th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_India#/media/File:Flag_of_India.svg">president</a> of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rameswaram">Rameswaram</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> , he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation">Defence Research and Development Organisation</a> (DRDO) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISRO">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the <b>Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

                Kalam was elected as the 11th <b>president</b> of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, India's highest civilian honour.

            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus">Hindu</a> pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15]
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]

            <h3>Career as a scientist</h3><hr>
        <p>
            After graduating from the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Institute_of_Technology">Madras Institute of Technology</a> in 1960, Kalam joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Development_Establishment">Aeronautical Development Establishment</a> of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at <a href=""></a>.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]

<p>While much of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a> attention turned to space, it did not put aside its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the X-1's supersonic flight to build an aircraft capable of hypersonic flight. The North American X-15 was a joint NASA-U.S. Air Force program,[10] with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program technologies, as well as ramjet and scramjet propulsion.[4]</p>
